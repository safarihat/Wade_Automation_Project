  <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Pathways to Automation</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Welcome to Wade Automation. We help small and medium-sized businesses in New Zealand and beyond streamline their operations—step by step.</p>

  <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2>🔹 Step 1: Start with What You Know</h2>
    <p>Begin with Excel spreadsheets to automate simple administrative tasks like sending emails, tracking appointments, or managing contact lists. This is a low-risk way to explore automation using tools you're already familiar with.</p>
    <p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
      <li>🤖 A robot that sends customer reminder emails and logs responses in a shared folder</li>
      <li>📊 Automatically generate weekly reports from spreadsheet data</li>
      <li>📅 Sync Excel with calendar tools to manage bookings and deadlines</li>
      <li>📁 Auto-sort and archive incoming form submissions into folders</li>
      <li>📧 Send follow-up emails based on spreadsheet status updates</li>
      <li>📋 Create task lists from spreadsheet entries and assign them via email</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2>🔸 Step 2: Modular Expansion</h2>
    <p>Once you're comfortable, expand into modular automation—tackling tasks like customer service, internal coordination, and document handling. These modules can be built independently and integrated gradually, giving you control and flexibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
      <li>📬 Automatically send onboarding emails and welcome packs to new clients</li>
      <li>📥 Route incoming inquiries to the right team member based on keywords</li>
      <li>📄 Generate templated documents (quotes, proposals) from spreadsheet data</li>
      <li>📆 Schedule meetings and send calendar invites based on availability</li>
      <li>📌 Track customer feedback and flag urgent issues for follow-up</li>
      <li>📂 Organize internal files and folders based on project status</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2>🔹 Step 3: Integration with Software Providers</h2>
    <p>Next, connect your internal systems with SaaS platforms like CRMs, help desks, and scheduling tools. This allows for seamless data flow and reduces manual input across departments.</p>
    <p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
      <li>🔗 Sync customer data between Excel and your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Zoho)</li>
      <li>📦 Connect support ticket systems to email and chat platforms</li>
      <li>📈 Use AI to analyze customer interactions and suggest improvements</li>
      <li>📤 Push lead data into marketing tools for automated follow-ups</li>
      <li>📋 Auto-update task boards (e.g., Trello, Asana) from spreadsheet changes</li>
      <li>📨 Trigger SMS or email alerts based on CRM activity</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2>🔸 Step 4: Full Workflow Automation</h2>
    <p>Finally, unify your entire business workflow—from customer onboarding to service delivery—using APIs and custom integrations. This is where automation becomes transformational.</p>
    <p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
      <li>🛠️ Build end-to-end workflows that trigger actions across multiple systems</li>
      <li>📲 Use chatbots to handle customer inquiries and escalate complex issues</li>
      <li>📤 Automatically file documents, update records, and notify stakeholders</li>
      <li>📦 Automate service delivery updates and notify customers in real time</li>
      <li>🧠 Use AI to summarize customer conversations and generate action items</li>
      <li>📅 Coordinate team schedules and resource allocation across departments</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><em>These are just simple examples—custom automation solutions are available to suit your unique business needs.</em></p>
